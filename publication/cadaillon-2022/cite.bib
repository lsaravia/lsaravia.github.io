 abstract = {Toxigenic algal blooms have been reported since 1886 in the Beagle Channel, at the southern limit of South America, mainly associated with the occurrence of paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) toxins produced by dinoflagellates of the genus Alexandrium. Toxic outbreaks have serious impacts on marine wildlife and ecosystem services, particularly on fisheries and mussel aquaculture. Within the framework of the Shellfish Toxicity Monitoring Program carried out close to Almanza in Beagle Channel eastern coastal waters, here we analyzed the spatiotemporal patterns of PSP toxins in the Magellan mussel Aulacomya ater and the blue mussel Mytilus edulis, measured by the mouse bioassay for 12 years, between 2005 -- 2017. PSP outbreaks occurred mostly during summer and their duration was significantly longer than for outbreaks detected during spring and winter. A marked interannual variability in their magnitude was also evident. The largest outbreaks were detected in summers 2010 - 2011, in extreme warm and low-wind conditions, reaching up to 5600 \textmug saxitoxin equivalent per 100 g of tissue, causing a closure of shellfish fisheries of up to 200 days. Small scale spatial variability in PSP was also found, the highest values being observed in the main mussel culture areas, and the lowest in the natural mussel beds. PSP toxicities for the Magellan mussel were significantly higher than for the blue mussel. Natural detoxification in mussels from Beagle Channel followed an exponential decay, with mean detoxification rates of 3.5% toxin day-1, lower than those from elsewhere in the world for similar PSP toxin concentrations, which means a longer time to attain concentration limits safe for human consumption. Understanding PSP dynamics is important to avoid large economic losses related to halting mussel production.},
