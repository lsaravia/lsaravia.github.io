 abstract = {Ecosystem sustainable use requires reliable information about its biotic and abiotic structure and functioning. Accurate knowledge of trophic relations is central for the understanding of ecosystem dynamics, which in turn, is essential for food web stability analyzes and the development of sustainable practices. There is a rapid growth in the knowledge on how belowground biodiversity regulates the structure and functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. Although, the available information about trophic relationships is hard to find and fragmented. Most of the informations available worldwide about the food resources of soil microarthropods suggested that out of 3105 hits of initial research on this aspect only a total of 196 published works related particular species, genera, and families to particular trophic resources, the majority of them dealing with soils of the Palearctic region. From the 196 publications we extracted 3009 records relating specific taxonomic groups to their trophic resources, 20 percent mention saprophytic fungi as a food resource, 16 percent cite microfauna, 11 percent mention bacteria, 10 percent litter and 8 percent cite Springtails. The available information was highly skewed, the 73.71 percent comes from Acari, and within these, 50.62 percent correspond just to Sarcoptiformes. The literature on Collembola is very scarce and most of the information is on arthropleona. The review also highlights that available research on the use of trophic resources comes from European sites and the information on this aspect from other parts of the soils of the world is still at large but unknown.},
