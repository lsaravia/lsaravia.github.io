  abstract = {This package simulates the assembly of ecological networks from a regional metaweb. Two main models are implemented; first the trophic theory of island biogeography [2] with the addition that secondary extinctions are not fixed but happen with a defined probability. Second a generalized Lotka-Volterra stochastic model. Species can migrate from the metaweb and establish the ecological interactions specified in the metaweb.},
