Climatic change and other anthropogenic drivers such as deforestation and land use change could produce abrupt changes in fire regimes, potentially triggering transition from forests to savannah or grasslands ecosystems with large accompanying biodiversity losses. The interplay between climate change and deforestation might intensify fire ignition and spread, potentially giving rise to more extensive, intense, and frequent fires, but this is highly uncertain. We use a simple forest-fire model to analyze the possible changes in the Amazon region's fire regime that depend on climate change-related variables. We first explored the model behavior and found that there are two possible regime changes: a critical regime that implies high variability in fire extent and mega-fires, and an absorbing phase transition which would produce the extinction of the forest and transition to a different vegetation state. We parameterize the model using remote sensing data on fire extent and temperature, and show that it demonstrates proficiency in predicting past fires. Upon considering 21st-century climate projections and deforestation scenarios, our findings suggest that the Amazon region is not currently nearing any of these regime changes but predict a consistent increase in fire extent mainly induced by deforestation. Therefore, stopping deforestation could be an important factor in reducing the potential for drastic alterations in tropical forests of the Amazon region.","tags":["critical transitions","forest fires"],"title":"Modelling Amazon fire regimes under climate change scenarios","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Leonardo A.

The policies of many conservation agencies are still prioritizing the preservation of a single large habitat area (SL) versus several small areas of the same size (SS), despite empirical support favouring SS. However, to date, while many studies have explored this issue using model communities, the results are mixed. In competitive community models, fragmentation has a negative effect at low habitat amounts, whereas neutral community models suggest positive effects. This work aims to explore spatial multispecies models to verify the SS {$\u003e$} SL pattern and determine its causes. We used three types of models: a classical neutral, neutral with habitat selection and a competitive hierarchical model. All models have three parameters, namely extinction, reproduction and dispersal distance. In the classical neutral model, species are equivalent and have the same parameters; when there is a reproduction event, they send the propagule to a surrounding patch blindly, and if the patch is already occupied, the propagule dies. In the neutral with habitat selection model, the propagules select an empty patch, so their survival is ensured. In the hierarchical model, species have competitive dominance and more dominant ones can replace the less dominant with a replacement rate parameter. We use 100 species and start simulating the colonization of an empty area; then, we destroy a fixed amount of habitat using different regular patch sizes. The results for all models are almost always that SS retains more species than SL. The extinction of species in patches depends on the quotient between reproduction and extinction rates in relation to patch size. The only case when SL {$\u003e$} SS is when dispersal is insufficient to connect patches, and patch size is smaller than the minimum to prevent extinction. If patch size is above the critical size to maintain local populations, the SS {$\u003e$} SL pattern is due to the sampling effect of aggregated species distribution combined with the reduction of dispersal ability of species. High-dispersal rates produce the homogenization of species distribution and a reduction of species richness and this is why habitat fragmentation by habitat loss retains more species when patches are smaller. The model predicts that if a set of species have more dispersal capabilities, the SS effect would be lower than for species with less dispersal.","tags":["Neutral model","fragmentation"],"title":"Why there are more species in several small patches versus few large patches: A multispecies modelling approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Susanne Kortsch","Leonardo A.

The arrangement of plant species within a landscape influences pollination via changes in pollinator movement trajectories and plant–pollinator encounter rates. Yet the combined effects of landscape composition and pollinator traits (especially specialisation) on pollination success remain hard to quantify empirically.\n2. We used an individual-based model to explore how landscape and pollinator specialisation (degree) interact to influence pollination. We modelled variation in the landscape by generating gradients of plant species intermixing—from no mixing to complete intermixing. Furthermore, we varied the level of pollinator specialisation by simulating plant–pollinator (six to eight species) networks of different connectance. We then compared the impacts of these drivers on three proxies for pollination: visitation rate, number of consecutive visits to the focal plant species and expected number of plants pollinated.\n3. We found that the spatial arrangements of plants and pollinator degree interact to determine pollination success, and that the influence of these drivers on pollination depends on how pollination is estimated. For most pollinators, visitation rate increases in more plant mixed landscapes. Compared to the two more functional measures of pollination, visitation rate overestimates pollination service. This is particularly severe in landscapes with high plant intermixing and for generalist pollinators. Interestingly, visitation rate is less influenced by pollinator traits (pollinator degree and body size) than are the two functional metrics, likely because ‘visitation rate’ ignores the order in which pollinators visit plants. However, the visitation sequence order is crucial for the expected number of plants pollinated, since only prior visits to conspecific individuals can contribute to pollination. We show here that this order strongly depends on the spatial arrangements of plants, on pollinator traits and on the interaction between them.\n4. Taken together, our findings suggest that visitation rate, the most commonly used proxy for pollination in network studies, should be complemented with more functional metrics which reflect the frequency with which individual pollinators revisit the same plant species. Our findings also suggest that measures of landscape structure such as plant intermixing and density—in combination with pollinators' level of specialism—can improve estimates of the probability of pollination.","tags":["Ecological Networks","Pollination","Individual based models","Netlogo"],"title":"Landscape composition and pollinator traits interact to influence pollination success in an individual-based model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Giorgio Nicoletti","Leonardo A.

We find that the 2019–2020 peak is associated with signatures typically found near critical points. We introduce a modeling framework based on forest-fire models to study the properties of these emergent fire outbreaks, showing that the behavior observed during the 2019–2020 fire season matches the one of a percolation transition, where system-size outbreaks appear.

Marina","Leonardo A. Saravia"],"categories":[],"content":"In nature species interact among each other in many ways. The most common and studied interaction is that between a predator and its prey. A food web can be defined as a network of interactions that describes who eats whom in a certain ecosystem and at a certain time of the year. In any ecosystem, in a terrestrial, freshwater or marine environment, the so-called food web is comprised by lots of species (hundreds) and interactions (thousands), showing a complex network of predator-prey interactions.\nIn a recent paper in the Journal of Animal Ecology, we studied the assembly process of food webs, that means how the complex network of interactions is formed and which are the principal factors that drive such processes. To put it in simple words, our research question was the following: what determines the structure of a food web?\nDue to previous investigations of colleagues we now know that the structure of a food web is the result of community assembly, which is a repeated process of species arrival, colonisation and local extinction. This implies that there are two major components that determine the structure of a food web: 1) the composition of species from where individuals migrate to new habitats, referred to as the regional pool or metaweb; and 2) a selective process that determines which species can arrive and persist in the new habitat. We also know that the first to colonise new habitats are species with a broad diet (i.e. great variety of prey). Thus, predator-prey interactions are established during the assembly process that begins the formation of a network of interactions: the food web “in progress”. Added to this, the characteristics of the habitat (substrate, climatic conditions) and the dispersal capability of the species are important factors that also control the assembly process of the food web, determining which species might be able to persist in time.\nThe structure of a food web is ultimately constrained by the species and potential interactions that exist in the regional pool, that is, the metaweb. Such metaweb is shaped by evolutionary and biogeographical processes that imply large spatial and temporal scales, containing many habitats and communities. Each of the local communities can have different food web structures, in terms of species and interactions among them. Some theorists conceive of assembly as a non-Darwinian selection process, whereby species and particular structures that destabilise the food web will be lost and stabilising structures will persist. Therefore, we should expect those stabilising structures to be over-represented in local food webs compared to the metaweb.\nTo test the hypothesis that the selective processes are responsible for food web structure, we created an assembly model, where species migrate from a regional pool and persist in a theoretical local food web given at least one prey item available. The model considers colonisation-extinction and secondary extinctions (i.e. if a species arrives and none of its prey are present) events constrained by network structure that is represented by predator-prey interactions. Thus, the model does not include local selective processes and habitat constraints that are thought to control the assembly process. Then we compared the theoretical local food webs created from the assembly model with real food webs. We hypothesised that, if local processes like stability determine the food web structure, then we should observe a consistent difference in the network structural characteristics between real food webs and those assembled from the model. To test our hypothesis we compiled 58 real food webs from a variety of regions and ecosystems: 2 marine food webs from Antarctica, 50 freshwater ones from the Adirondacks region and 6 from an Arthropod community in six islands of the Florida Keys.\nContrary to our expectations, we found that most structural characteristics didn’t differ between the real and modeled food webs. We particularly compared properties related to stability, such as modularity and the frequency of three-species motifs, and habitat filtering and dispersal limitation, such as topological roles that characterise how many interactions a species has within their module and/or between modules (i.e. modules are formed by a group of species that share more interactions compared to other species). This suggests that evolutionary and biogeographical processes that are established in the metaweb are more important and might drive the studied structural characteristics in a food web than local processes such as habitat filtering and dispersal limitations. In particular, our study forces us to re-think the way we approach the study of food web structure.

In the long term, some species are more vulnerable to fishery impacts than others, which can lead to permanent changes on the food web. The trophic relationships between predator and prey constitute the food web and it represents a network of the energy channels in an ecosystem. In turn, the network structure influences ecosystem diversity and stability.The first aim of this study was to describe for the first time the food web of the San Jorge Gulf (Patagonia Argentina) with high resolution, i.e. to the species level when information is available. The San Jorge Gulf was subject to intense fisheries thus our second aim is to analyse the food web structure with and without fishery to evaluate if the bottom-trawl industrial fishery altered the network structure and stability. We used several network metrics like: mean trophic level, omnivory, modularity and quasi-sign stability. We included these metrics because they are related to stability and can be evaluated using predator diets that can weight the links between predators and prey. The network presented 165 species organized in five trophic levels. The inclusion of a fishery node adds 71 new trophic links. All weighted and unweighted metrics showed differences between the two networks, reflecting a decrease in stability when fishery was included in the system. Thus, our results suggested a probable change of state of the system. The observed changes in species abundances since the fishery was established, could represent the state change predicted by network analysis. Our results show how changes in the stability of food webs can be used to evaluate the impacts of human activity on ecosystems.","tags":["ecological Networks","food web structure","modularity","QSS Stability"],"title":"Network Analysis Can Detect Changes In Food Web Stability Produced By Bottom Trawl Fishery In Patagonia","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Iara Rodriguez","Tomás I.

High-latitude marine ecosystems are being affected by environmental stressors and biological invasions. In the West Antarctic Peninsula these transformations are mainly driven by climate change, while in the sub-Antarctic region by anthropogenic activities. Understanding the differences between these areas is necessary to monitor the changes that are expected to occur in the upcoming decades. Here, we compared the structure and stability of Antarctic (Potter Cove) and sub-Antarctic (Beagle Channel) marine food webs. We compiled species trophic interactions (predator-prey) and calculated complexity, structure and stability metrics. Even if both food webs presented the same connectance, we found important differences between them. The Beagle Channel food web is more complex, but less stable and sensitive to the loss of its most connected species, while the Potter Cove food web presented lower complexity and greater stability against perturbations.","tags":[],"title":"Marine food webs are more complex but less stable in sub-Antarctic (Beagle Channel, Argentina) than in Antarctic (Potter Cove, Antarctic Peninsula) regions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Leonardo A.

Local food webs result from a sequence of colonisations and extinctions by species from the regional pool or metaweb, i.e., the assembly process. Assembly is theorised to be a selective process: whether or not certain species or network structures can persist is partly determined by local processes including habitat filtering and dynamical constraints. Consequently, local food web structure should reflect these processes. 2. The goal of this study was to test evidence for these selective processes by comparing the structural properties of real food webs to the expected distribution given the metaweb. We were particularly interested in ecological dynamics; if the network properties commonly associated with dynamical stability are indeed the result of stability constraints, then they should deviate from expectation in the direction predicted by theory. 3. To create a null expectation, we used the novel approach of randomly assembling model webs by drawing species and interactions from the empirical metaweb. The assembly model permitted colonisation and extinction, and required a consumer species to have at least one prey, but had no habitat type nor population dynamical constraints. Three data sets were used: (1) the marine Antarctic metaweb, with 2 local food-webs; (2) the 50 lakes of the Adirondacks; and (3) the arthropod community from Florida Keys’ classic defaunation experiment. 4. Contrary to our expectations, we found that there were almost no differences between empirical webs and those resulting from the null assembly model. Few empirical food webs showed significant differences with network properties, motif representations and topological roles. Network properties associated with stability did not deviate from expectation in the direction predicted by theory. 5. Our results suggest that — for the commonly used metrics we considered — local food web structure is not strongly influenced by dynamical nor habitat restrictions. Instead, the structure is inherited from the metaweb. This suggests that the network properties typically attributed as causes or consequences of ecological stability are instead a by-product of the assembly process (i.e., spandrels), and may potentially be too coarse to detect the true signal of dynamical constraint.","tags":["metawebs","ecological network assembly","ecological Networks","food web structure","modularity","QSS Stability","motifs","topological roles"],"title":"Ecological network assembly: how the regional metaweb influences local food webs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Leonardo A.

This is the B model of the paper 1, I read it long ago and for many years I wanted to make a version of it, finally, I did it.\nYou can find the source code here https://github.com/lsaravia/snim, to install it you need to clone it using git clone or download and compile it, following the instructions in the README will be enough.\nThen the description of the model from 1 is the following\nThe second model again involves a set of S (possible) species plus empty sites (pseudospecies labelled 0). This set (the species pool) $\\Omega(S)$ is then a discrete set:\n$\\Omega(S) = {0,1,2,…,S}$\nwhere 0 indicates empty space, available to all species from the pool. Three basic types of transition are allowed to occur. Let us call $ A,B \\in \\Omega(S )$ two given spcies present at a given step. These possible transitions are summarized as follows.\n(i) Immigration: an empty site is occupied by a species randomly chosen from the set of (non-empty) species, i.e. $A \\in \\Omega(S )-{0}$:\n$0 \\xrightarrow{u_i} A$\nThis occurs with a probability of colonization (of empty sites) $\\mu_i$ . Notice that this colonization depends on the particular species.\n(ii) Death: All occupied sites can become empty with some fixed probability $e_i$ :\n$A \\xrightarrow{e_i} 0$\n(iii) Interaction: the same rule as in model A is used, but here the probability of success $P_{ij}$ is weighted by the coefficients of the interaction matrix. Here we use\n$P_{ij} = \\pi[\\Omega_{ij} - \\Omega_{ji}]$\nwhere $\\pi[x]=x$ when $x \u0026gt; 0$ and zero otherwise. This probability of an interaction occurring in the system between species $i$ and $j$ is a measure of the interaction strength linking interacting species.\nSo I’ll demonstrate how to use it from R\nThen the fun part is to make simulations, for that we need the parameters: there is an species parameter file and a simulation parameter file.\nThe structure of the species parameter file is in the following example:\n# Model parameters example # 3 10000 # 3 species, total habitat 10000 0.1 0.1 0.1 # Immigration vector 1 1 1 # Extinction vector # Omega interaction matriz # Species 0 is empty space # Species 1 Predator eats 2 and 3 # Species 2 has higher growth rate # Species 3 outcompete species 2 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 3.0 2.0 4.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 2.0 0.0 0.5 0.0 The lines that start with ‘#’ are comments, then the first 3 lines define the general parameters.\nThe first row define a total amount of habitat in our simulation, then the number of species.\nSpecies can migrate from the outside, this asumes that the habitat is sorrounded by a regional or bigger community that is the source of individuals. Then the 2nd. row is the immigration rate vector. Species can go locally extinct or death, we assume that they don’t live forever. And finally the ‘omega’ or interaction matrix, the first column are the intrinsic growth rate of species, and the first row is a special species: the empty space.\nThen we need the simulation parameters, this is a simple example\n# Simulation parameters example # rndSeed = 0\t# 0 means a random rndSeed nEvals = 500 # number of time steps tau = 0.01 # Integration step iniCond = 1000 # Initial condition of abundance of species # if only one number is specified all the species will have the same initial conditions So to run from ‘RStats’ there is a set of functions included, and we need to set a global variable with the binary of the model. If we call simul.cfg to the simulation file, and model3.par to the parameters file the following code will run the model\n# Global path to the binary of SNIM model # snimBin \u0026lt;- \u0026#34;~/Dropbox/cpp/CaNew/snim/dist/Release/GNU-Linux/snim\u0026#34; source(\u0026#34;R/snim_functions.r\u0026#34;) out \u0026lt;- run_snim_plot(\u0026#34;simul.cfg\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;model3.par\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;model.out\u0026#34;) One nice addition to this plot is to add an annimation with the R package gganimate, I only changed the nEvals = 100 in the simulation parameters file, and made another run of the model, then plot with the out dataframe,\nrequire(gganimate) ggplot(filter(out,Species!=0), aes(x = Time, y = Density,colour=Species)) + geom_line() + theme_bw() + scale_y_log10() + xlab(\u0026#34;Years\u0026#34;) + transition_reveal(Time) Have fun!\nSole, R.

En la Antártida, el microfitobentos se encuentra principalmente dominado por diatomeas (Zacher et al. 2007, Campana et al. 2009, Wulff et al. 2011) y tiene un rol importante en el proceso sucesional ya que son las primeras en colonizar el fondo rocoso (Zacher et al. 2007, Campana et al. 2017). Las macroalgas son fuente de alimentación para organismos asociados al bentos (Amsler et al. 2005) y representan un aporte significativo de materia orgánica particulada y disuelta a la trama trófica costera (Fischer y Wiencke, 1992). Además provén hábitat y refugio para numerosos organismos bentónicos y bento-pelágicos (Wiencke y Amsler 2014). En las últimas décadas se observó un marcado retroceso del glaciar que rodea caleta Potter, dejando al descubierto áreas rocosas sin hielo, potencialmente aptas para ser colonizadas por macroalgas. A partir del 2008 se iniciaron una serie de estudios a fin de describir y cuantificar el efecto de las perturbaciones asociadas al retroceso glaciario tales como el aumento en la carga de sedimento y la consiguiente disminución del grado de penetración de la luz sobre la comunidad de algas bentónicas de la caleta. Las primeras observaciones mostraron una notable presencia de algas en aquellos sitios donde antes no se encontraban presentes e inclusive fueron registradas creciendo en sitios altamente disturbados próximos al glaciar (Quartino et al. 2013).\nEn el ecosistema de caleta Potter las zonas costeras de fondos rocosos están mayormente colonizadas por las grandes algas pardas endémicas Desmarestia menziesii J.Agardh, D. anceps Montagne e Himantothallus grandifolius(A.Gepp \u0026amp; E.S.Gepp) Zinova. Estas macroalgas presentan los mayores valores de biomasa (Quartino y Boraso de Zaixso 2008), son endémicas de la Antártida e islas adyacentes y están adaptadas a las temperaturas frías extremas, por lo que podrían verse afectadas ante el inminente calentamiento global (Wiencke y Amsler 2012). Un calentamiento creciente, junto con variaciones en la disponibilidad de luz en zonas costeras, debido a la mayor carga de sedimento proveniente del agua de deshielo de los glaciares, podría llevar a consecuencias imprevistas para los productores primarios bentónicos (macroalgas) y su fauna asociada. Esto, a su vez, podría afectar el funcionamiento del ecosistema costero antártico, tal como ya lo han observado en el Ártico (Bartsch et al. 2016), en donde se han registrado variaciones en la biomasa de las comunidades 1macroalgales, en la fauna asociada y en los invertebrados bentónicos (por ej., aumento de organismos filtradores).

It is known that a critical transition exists between these two states, but the spatial aspect of this transition has not been studied. Our aim is to study the spatial aspect of the transition and propose early warning signals to detect it. We used a stochastic, spatially explicit model that spans a continuum from neutral to niche communities, and is driven by the intensity of hierarchical competition. The transition is indicated by the emergence of a large patch formed by one species that connects the whole area. The properties of this patch can be used as early warning indicators of a critical transition. If competition intensity increases beyond the critical point, our model shows a sudden decrease of the Shannon diversity index and a gentle decline in species richness. The critical point occurs at a very low value of competitive intensity, with the rate of migration from the metacommunity greatly influencing the position of this critical point. As an example, we apply our new method of early warning indicators to the Barro Colorado Tropical forest, which, as expected, appears to be far from a critical transition. Low values of competitive intensity were also reported by previous studies for different high-diversity real communities, suggesting that these communities are located before the critical point. A small increase of competitive interactions could push them across the transition, however, to a state in which diversity is much lower. Thus this new early warnings indicator could be used to monitor high diversity ecosystems that are still undisturbed.","tags":null,"title":"Biodiversity Collapse and Early Warning Indicators in a Spatial Phase Transition between Neutral and Niche Communities","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tomás I.

A food-web approach includes both species and energy flows among them, providing a natural framework for characterizing species’ ecological roles and the mechanisms through which biodiversity influences ecosystem dynamics. Here we present for the first time a high-resolution food web for a marine ecosystem at Potter Cove (northern Antarctic Peninsula). Eleven food web properties were analyzed in order to document network complexity, structure and topology. We found a low linkage density (3.4), connectance (0.04) and omnivory percentage (45), as well as a short path length (1.8) and a low clustering coefficient (0.08). Furthermore, relating the structure of the food web to its dynamics, an exponential degree distribution (in- and out-links) was found. This suggests that the Potter Cove food web may be vulnerable if the most connected species became locally extinct. For two of the three more connected functional groups, competition overlap graphs imply high trophic interaction between demersal fish and niche specialization according to feeding strategies in amphipods. On the other hand, the prey overlap graph shows also that multiple energy pathways of carbon flux exist across benthic and pelagic habitats in the Potter Cove ecosystem. Although alternative food sources might add robustness to the web, network properties (low linkage density, connectance and omnivory) suggest fragility and potential trophic cascade effects.","tags":["Antarctica","Degree distribution","Ecological Networks","Marine ecosystem"],"title":"The Food Web of Potter Cove (Antarctica): Complexity, Structure and Function","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tomás I.

One such property is the small-world topology that combines a high clustering and a small distance between nodes of the network. This property may increase food web resilience but make them more sensitive to the extinction of connected species. Food web theory has been developed principally from freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems, largely omitting marine habitats. If theory needs to be modified to accommodate observations from marine ecosystems, based on major differences in several topological characteristics is still on debate. Here we investigated if the small-world topology is a common structural pattern in marine food webs. We developed a novel, simple and statistically rigorous method to examine the largest set of complex marine food webs to date. More than half of the analyzed marine networks exhibited a similar or lower characteristic path length than the random expectation, whereas 39% of the webs presented a significantly higher clustering than its random counterpart. Our method proved that 5 out of 28 networks fulfilled both features of the small-world topology: short path length and high clustering. This work represents the first rigorous analysis of the small-world topology and its associated features in high-quality marine networks. We conclude that such topology is a structural pattern that is not maximized in marine food webs; thus it is probably not an effective model to study robustness, stability and feasibility of marine ecosystems.","tags":null,"title":"Architecture of Marine Food Webs: To Be or Not Be a ‘Small-World’","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Georgina Cordone","Tomás I Marina","Vanesa Salinas","Santiago R Doyle","Leonardo A Saravia","Fernando R Momo"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"e69be68dc230bc1a7d3190becff079fa","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/cordone-2018/","publishdate":"2020-01-17T23:02:22.365945Z","relpermalink":"/publication/cordone-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"Antarctica is seriously affected by climate change, particularly at the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) where a rapid regional warming is observed. Potter Cove is a WAP fjord at Shetland Islands that constitutes a biodiversity hotspot where over the last years, Potter Cove annual air temperatures averages increased by 0.66 °C, coastal glaciers declined, and suspended particulate matter increased due to ice melting. Macroalgae are the main energy source for all consumers and detritivores of Potter Cove. Some effects of climate change favor pioneer macroalgae species that exploit new ice-free areas and can also decline rates of photosynthesis and intensify competition between species due to the increase of suspended particulate matter. In this study, we evaluated possible consequences of climate change at Potter Cove food web by simulating the extinction of macroalgae and detritus using a topological approach with thresholds of extinction. Thresholds represent the minimum number of incoming links necessary for species’ survival. When we simulated the extinctions of macroalgae species at random, a threshold of extinction beyond 50% was necessary to obtain a significant number of secondary extinctions, while with a 75% threshold a real collapse of the food web occurred. Our results indicate that Potter Cove food web is relative robust to macroalgae extinction. This is dramatically different from what has been found in other food webs, where the reduction of 10% in prey intake caused a disproportionate increase of secondary extinctions. Robustness of the Potter Cove food web was mediated by omnivory and redundancy, which had an important relevance in this food web. When we eliminated larger-biomass species more secondary extinctions occurred, a similar response was observed when more connected species were deleted, yet there was no correlation between species of larger-biomass and high-degree. This similarity could be explained because both criteria involved key species that produced an emerging effect on the food web. In this way, large-biomass and high-degree species could be acting as source for species with few trophic interactions or low redundancy. Based on this work, we expect the Potter Cove food web to be robust to changes in macroalgae species caused by climate change until a high threshold of stress is reached, and then negative effects are expected to spread through the entire food web leading to its collapse.","tags":["Antarctic","Extinctions","Food webs","Macroalgae loss"],"title":"Effects of Macroalgae Loss in an Antarctic Marine Food Web: Applying Extinction Thresholds to Food Web Studies","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Leonardo A Saravia","Santiago Doyle","Ben Bond-Lamberty"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"c784394a990d00afafbfc2871b39b1b0","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/saravia-2018-a/","publishdate":"2020-01-17T23:02:22.37071Z","relpermalink":"/publication/saravia-2018-a/","section":"publication","summary":"The replacement of forest areas with human-dominated landscapes usually leads to fragmentation, altering the structure and function of the forest.

However, in Antarctica, further studies are needed for a more complete understanding of these systems. When conspicuous Antarctic intertidal communities occur, macroalgae are a key component. Given that intertidal communities have a fast response to variations in environmental conditions and could reflect climate fluctuations, we conducted a non-destructive study with photographic transects in an intertidal zone at Potter Peninsula, Isla 25 de Mayo/King George Island, over four years and during five months of the warm season. We tested the general hypothesis that macroalgal intertidal communities are mainly structured by the vertical stress gradient and that changes in temperature between seasons and between years have a great influence in the macroalgal community structure. Spatial, seasonal and inter-annual variations were studied using GLM, quantile regression and NMDS ordinations. The vertical stress gradient was the main factor that explained macroalgal cover. The Low and the Middle level shared similarities, but the latter was more variable. The High level had the lowest cover, richness and diversity. The dominant species here was the endemic red alga Pyropia endiviifolia, which is strongly adapted to extreme conditions. At the Middle level, there was a significant increase in macroalgal cover during spring months, and it stabilized in summer. Inter-annual variations showed that there is a strong variation in the total macroalgal cover and community structure over the studied years. Environmental conditions have a significant effect in shaping the studied intertidal community, which is very sensitive to climate oscillations. An increase in temperature produced a decrease of annual ice foot cover, number of snow days and - as a result - an increase in macroalgal cover. In a global climate-change scenario, a shift in species composition could also occur. Species with wide physiological tolerance that grow in warmer conditions, like Palmaria decipiens, could benefit, while other species will be discriminated. More detailed studies are necessary to predict future changes in Antarctic intertidal communities.","tags":["Aquatic communities","Benthos","Community structure","Ecological zonation","Isla 25 de Mayo/King George Island","Seaweeds"],"title":"Life between Tides: Spatial and Temporal Variations of an Intertidal Macroalgal Community at Potter Peninsula, South Shetland Islands, Antarctica","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Leonardo A.

One problem with these general patterns is that different theories can generate the same predictions, and for this reason, they cannot be used to detect different mechanisms of community assembly. A solution is to search for more sensitive patterns, for example by extending the SAR to the whole SAD. A generalized dimension (Dq) approach has been proposed to study the scaling of SAD, but to date, there has been no evaluation of the ability of this pattern to detect different mechanisms. An equivalent way to express SAD is the rank-abundance distribution (RAD). Here I introduce a new way to study SAD scaling using a spatial version of RAD: the species-rank surface (SRS), which can be analysed using Dq. Thus, there is an old Dq based on SAR Dq(SAR), and a new one based on SRS Dq(SRS). I perform spatial simulations to examine the relationship of Dq with SAD, spatial patterns and number of species. Finally, I compare the power of both Dq, SAD, SAR exponent and the fractal information dimension to detect different community patterns using a continuum of hierarchical and neutral spatially explicit models. The SAD, Dq(SAD) and Dq(SRS) all had good performance in detecting models with contrasting mechanisms. Dq(SRS), however, had a better fit to data and allowed comparisons between hierarchical communities where the other methods failed. The SAR exponent and information dimension had low power and should not be used. SRS and Dq(SRS) could be interesting methods to study community or macroecological patterns.","tags":[],"title":"A New Method to Analyse Species Abundances in Space Using Generalized Dimensions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["F Pasotti","L.

Three soil uses were evaluated: 1-Fifty year old naturalized grasslands, low use intensity; 2-Recent agricultural fields, intermediate use intensity, and 3-Fifty year old intensive agricultural fields, high use intensity. Three different sites for each soil use were evaluated from winter 2008 through summer 2011. Nine earthworm species were identified across all sampling sites. The sites shared five species: the native Microscolex dubius, and the introduced Aporrectodea caliginosa, A. rosea, Octalasion cyaneum, and O. lacteum, but they differed in relative abundance by soil use. The results show that the earthworm community structure is linked to and modulated by soil properties. Both species abundance and diversity showed significant differences depending on soil use intensity. A principal component analysis showed that species composition is closely related to the environmental variability. The ratio of native to exotic species was significantly lower in the intensive agricultural system when compared to the other two, lower disturbance systems. Microscolex dubius abundance was related to naturalized grasslands along with soil Ca, pH, mechanical resistance, and microbial respiration. Aporrectodea caliginosa abundance was related to high K levels, low enzymatic activity, slightly low pH, low Ca, and appeared related to the highly disturbed environment. Eukerria stagnalis and Aporrectodea rosea, commonly found in the recent agricultural system, were related to high soil moisture condition, low pH, low Ca and low enzymatic activity. These results show that earthworm assemblages can be good indicators of soil use intensities. In particular, Microscolex dubius, Aporrectodea caliginosa, and Aporrectodea rosea, showed different temporal patterns and species associations, due to the changes in soil properties attributable to soil use intensity, defined as the amount and type of agricultural operations.","tags":["Bioindicator","Earthworms","Farming systems","Soil ecology","Soil use intensity"],"title":"Earthworm Assemblages in Different Intensity of Agricultural Uses and Their Relation to Edaphic Variables","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Leonardo A Saravia"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388534400,"objectID":"3f510cabd8dabcda0215fa3f30784c62","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/saravia-2014/","publishdate":"2020-01-17T23:02:22.369768Z","relpermalink":"/publication/saravia-2014/","section":"publication","summary":"Multifractals have been applied to characterize complex communities in a spatial context.

Phytoplankton biomass is typically low compared to other Antarctic shelf environments, with average spring - summer values below 1 mg chlorophyll a m-3. The physical conditions in the area (reduced irradiance induced by particles originated from the land, intense winds) limit the coastal productivity at King George Island (KGI), as a result of shallow Sverdrup's critical depths (Zc) and large turbulent mixing depths (Zt). In January 2010 a large phytoplankton bloom with a maximum of around 20, and monthly averages of 4 (PC) and 6 (AB) mg chlorophyll a m-3, was observed in the area, making it by far the largest recorded bloom over the last 20 years. Dominant phytoplankton species were the typical bloom-forming diatoms that are usually found in the western Antarctic Peninsula area. Anomalously cold air temperature and dominant winds from the eastern sector seem to explain adequate light:mixing environment. Local physical conditions were analyzed by means of the relation between Zc and Zt and conditions were found adequate for allowing phytoplankton development. However, a multi-year analysis indicates that these conditions may be necessary but not sufficient to guarantee phytoplankton accumulation. The relation between maximum chlorophyll a values and air temperature suggests that bottom-up control would render such large blooms even less frequent in KGI under the warmer climate expected in the area during the second half of the present century.","tags":null,"title":"On the Phytoplankton Bloom in Coastal Waters of Southern King George Island (Antarctica) in January 2010: An Exceptional Feature?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Leonardo Ariel Saravia","Adonis Giorgi","Fernando Momo"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1340582400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1340582400,"objectID":"edfe7695bc1cbce702882a13242476b8","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/saravia-2012-a/","publishdate":"2020-01-17T23:02:22.369441Z","relpermalink":"/publication/saravia-2012-a/","section":"publication","summary":"Periphyton is an aquatic community composed by algae, bacteria, fungi, and other microorganisms that can develop a complex architecture comparable to tropical forests. We analyzed the spatial pattern of a periphyton community along a succession developed in experimental tanks. Our aim was to identify regularities that may help us to explain the patchiness of this community. Therefore, we estimated the spatial pattern of periphyton biomass using a non-destructive image analysis technique to obtain a temporal series of the spatial distribution. These were analyzed using multifractal techniques. Multifractals are analogous to fractals but they look at the geometry of quantities instead of the geometry of pattern. To use these techniques the object of study must show scale invariance and then can be characterized by a spectra of fractal dimensions. Selforganization describes the evolution of complex structures that emerge spontaneously driven internally by variations of the system itself. The spatial distribution of biomass showed scale invariance at all stages of succession and as the periphyton developed in a homogeneous landscape, in a demonstration of self-organized behavior. Self-organization to a critical state (SOC) is presented in the complex systems literature as a general explanation for scale invariance in nature. SOC requires a mechanism where the history of past events in a place influence the actual dynamics, this was termed ecological memory. The scale invariance was found from the very beginning of the succession thus selforganized criticality is a very improbable explanation for the pattern because there would be not enough time for the build up of ecological memory. Positive interactions between algae and bacteria, and the existence of different spatial scales of colonization and growth are the likely causes of this pattern. Our work is a demonstration of how large scale patterns emerge from local biotic interactions.","tags":null,"title":"Multifractal Growth in Periphyton Communities","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Leonardo A.

Several studies have found this relationship in different ecosystems but here we prove that the community self-organizes and generates its own spatial heterogeneity influencing diversity.

If this phenomenon is common in natural systems, populations that do not oscillate can begin to fluctuate wildly without any change in the environmental conditions. However, the frequency of occurrence of supertransients is currently poorly understood even in model systems. Here we explore their occurrence in metapopulation models which relax the important assumption of global synchrony of events implicit in all the coupled map lattice models for which supertransients have so far been demonstrated. We find supertransients in all the models but always only for a very restricted range of parameter combinations. However, we also report for the first time another type of longer-lived transient (mesotransients) that occurs on shorter time-scales than supertransients and is found for a much wider set of conditions. We argue that these medium-term changes in the dynamics of populations can be of more ecological relevance than the long-term changes of supertransients.","tags":["Animal Migration","Animals","asynchrony","Biological","Ecosystem","Insects","Insects: physiology","Models","Population Density","Population Dynamics","spatial model","supertransients","synchrony"],"title":"The Importance of Transients' Dynamics in Spatially Extended Populations.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Leonardo A Saravia","Adonis Giorgi","Fernando R Momo"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":915148800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":915148800,"objectID":"079b572e9c71861d2f3e68d417efe5a5","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/saravia-1999/","publishdate":"2020-01-17T23:02:22.36814Z","relpermalink":"/publication/saravia-1999/","section":"publication","summary":"The collection of time-series of periphyton biomass is a difficult task due to the destructive nature of the standard methods.

This temporal variability is mainly produced by changes in running water velocity. The shear force caused by the friction of water over the surface of the periphyton produces a removal of biomass and creates open sites for colonization. Running water also brings new suspended algae that can establish on open sites. An increase in the velocity of the water can also improve the renewal of nutrients in depleted areas and the elimination of waste products, producing higher reproductive rates. In this paper, we have developed a model of periphyton biomass dynamics taking the water velocity and nutrient concentration as external driving variables influencing immigration, removal and reproductive rate of the algae. We fitted the model to field data encompassing high and low water velocities and different seasons. We have qualitatively compared the parameters obtained from different situations with the expected ones based on bibliographic information. The model has shown a good fit to field data and parameters were similar to expected ones, giving evidence that the model provides a good description for the processes that dominate the periphyton dynamics in running waters.
