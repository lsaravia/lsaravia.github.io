When trying to protect what is left, conservation agencies often prioritize preserving one large habitat area over several smaller areas of the same total size. However, recent studies suggest that preserving multiple smaller areas can actually be more effective for protecting species.\nTo better understand this, we used computer models to simulate how species communities respond to different habitat configurations. Our models analyzed three types of scenarios: species that do not compete with each other, species that can choose where to live, and species that compete for space. We also considered how far species can move (disperse), how quickly they reproduce, and how fast they go extinct.\nThe results show that, in most cases, having several smaller habitat patches protects more species than one large patch of the same total area. The only exception is when the species cannot move between the smaller patches and the patches are too small to support healthy populations on their own. Dispersal ability plays a key role: species that can move long distances tend to spread out evenly across the landscape, which reduces diversity, making them benefit less from having multiple small areas. On the other hand, species with lower dispersal ability tend to cluster in specific areas, increasing local diversity, so they benefit more from smaller areas, as long as they are not completely isolated.\nThese findings provide important insights into the best strategies for conserving biodiversity. While conventional wisdom has often favored preserving one large habitat, our models suggest that multiple smaller protected areas may often be a more effective approach, as long as the patches are large enough and connected enough for species to thrive.

We develop a spatial stochastic model to analyze the invasion dynamics of fire-adapted species into regions with historically low fire occurrence. The model incorporates two key parameters that characterize positive feedback with fire: post-fire vegetation regrowth and fire spread rates. After fire events, rapid vegetation regrowth facilitates the expansion of invasive species, which in turn increases both fire frequency and intensity. Our results reveal a continuous transition toward native species extinction as fire disturbance becomes the dominant factor in system dynamics. The system shows the highest sensitivity to external fluctuations during this transition phase. Spatial heterogeneity significantly influences the dynamics: notably, native species face higher extinction risk when invasive species are concentrated in a single cluster compared to random spatial distribution. These findings emphasize how spatial patterns of invasion, combined with fire-vegetation feedback, can accelerate native species decline.\n","tags":["forest-fire","invasion","stochastic models"],"title":"Dynamics of Invasion in Forest-Fire Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Leonardo A.

Climatic change and other anthropogenic drivers such as deforestation and land use change could produce abrupt changes in fire regimes, potentially triggering transition from forests to savannah or grasslands ecosystems with large accompanying biodiversity losses. The interplay between climate change and deforestation might intensify fire ignition and spread, potentially giving rise to more extensive, intense, and frequent fires, but this is highly uncertain. We use a simple forest-fire model to analyze the possible changes in the Amazon region's fire regime that depend on climate change-related variables. We first explored the model behavior and found that there are two possible regime changes: a critical regime that implies high variability in fire extent and mega-fires, and an absorbing phase transition which would produce the extinction of the forest and transition to a different vegetation state. We parameterize the model using remote sensing data on fire extent and temperature, and show that it demonstrates proficiency in predicting past fires. Upon considering 21st-century climate projections and deforestation scenarios, our findings suggest that the Amazon region is not currently nearing any of these regime changes but predict a consistent increase in fire extent mainly induced by deforestation. Therefore, stopping deforestation could be an important factor in reducing the potential for drastic alterations in tropical forests of the Amazon region.","tags":["Amazon forest","climate change","deforestation","forest-fire model","predictions"],"title":"Modelling Amazon Fire Regimes under Climate Change Scenarios","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tomás Ignacio Marina","Leonardo A.

Understanding how these networks respond to global change stressors is of increasing interest, especially along geographical gradients. This review summarizes potential stressor responses in marine food webs from the Southwest Atlantic to the Antarctic (45 - 78$^∘$S), encompassing areas such as San Jorge Gulf, Beagle Channel, Burdwood Bank, Scotia Sea, Potter Cove, and the Weddell Sea in Antarctica. The objectives are: 1) to describe the structure of marine food webs along this latitudinal axis using a network approach; 2) to identify predominant global change-related stressors affecting each ecosystem; and 3) to summarize observed food web changes and hypothesize on stressor impacts. The effects of stressors were primarily reviewed at the species level. Alternative hypotheses for each study area were formulated considering: a) main stressors; b) impacted parameters; c) node-level species properties; and d) network-level food web properties. Global warming emerges as the most common stressor among the studied areas across the latitudinal gradient, except in the Beagle Channel and Burdwood Bank, where alien species introduction and fisheries are more influential. We offer a series of alternative hypotheses on how warming may affect the food webs. This review emphasizes the benefits of using a network approach to understand and predict stressor effects in Southern Hemisphere marine ecosystems. This approach provides a holistic understanding of ecosystems, which enhances our ability to identify key species and their interactions, offering insights for ecosystem management and conservation in the face of global change stressors.","tags":null,"title":"The Response of Trophic Interaction Networks to Multiple Stressors along a Large-Scale Latitudinal Range in the Southern Hemisphere","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ulrike Braeckman","Karline Soetaert","Francesca Pasotti","Maria Liliana Quartino","Ann Vanreusel","Leonardo A.

Glacial ice scouring and lithogenic particle runoff increase turbidity and shape soft sediment benthic communities. This, in turn, has the potential to induce a shift in these systems from an autotrophic to a heterotrophic state. In this study, we investigated the influence of glacial runoff on carbon flows in the soft-sediment food web of Potter Cove, a well-studied shallow fjord located in the northern region of the West Antarctic Peninsula. We constructed linear inverse food web models using a dataset that includes benthic carbon stocks as well as carbon production and respiration rates. The dataset offers detailed spatial information across three locations and seasonal variations spanning three seasons, reflecting different degrees of disturbance from glacial melt runoff. In these highly resolved food web models, we quantified the carbon flows from various resource compartments (phytoplankton detritus, macroalgae, microphytobenthos, sediment detritus) to consumers (ranging from prokaryotes to various functional groups in meio-and macrofauna). Locations and seasons characterized by high glacial melt runoff exhibited distinct patterns of carbon flow compared to those with low glacial melt runoff. This difference was primarily driven by a less pronounced benthic primary production pathway, an impaired microbial loop and a lower secondary production of the dominant bivalve Aequiyoldia eightsii and other infauna. In contrast, the bivalve Laternula elliptica and meiofauna had the highest secondary production close to the glacier, where they are exposed to high glacial melt runoff. This study shows how the effects of glacial melt propagate from lower to higher trophic levels, thereby affecting the transfer of energy in the ecosystem.","tags":["Antarcticacoastal ecology","Carbon flow analysis","Food web alteration","glacial melt runoff","Linear inverse model"],"title":"Glacial Melt Impacts Carbon Flows in an Antarctic Benthic Food Web","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tomás I.

In recent years, such approaches have been successfully applied to study polar ecosystems, improving our knowledge on how they might respond to ongoing environmental changes. The Weddell Sea is one of the most studied marine ecosystems outside the Antarctic Peninsula in the Southern Ocean. Yet, few studies consider the known complexity of the Weddell Sea food web, which in its current form comprises 490 species and 16 041 predator--prey interactions. Here we analysed the Weddell Sea food web, focusing on the species and trophic interactions that underpin ecosystem structure and stability. We estimated the strength for each interaction in the food web, characterised species position in the food web using unweighted and weighted food web properties, and analysed species' roles with respect to the stability of the food web. We found that the distribution of the interaction strength (IS) at the food web level is asymmetric, with many weak interactions and few strong ones. We detected a positive relationship between species median IS and two unweighted properties (i.e. trophic level and the total number of interactions). We also found that only a few species possess key positions in terms of food web stability. These species are characterised by high median IS, a middle to high trophic level, a relatively high number of interactions, and middle to low trophic similarity. In this study, we integrated unweighted and weighted food web information, enabling a more complete assessment of the ecosystem structure and function of the Weddell Sea food web.

Understanding the complex interplay between structure and stability of marine food webs is crucial for assessing ecosystem resilience, particularly in the context of ongoing environmental changes. In this study, we estimate the interaction strength within the Potter Cove (South Shetland Islands, Antarctica) food web to elucidate the roles of species in its structure and functioning. We use these estimates to calculate food web stability in response to perturbations, conducting sequential extinctions to quantify the importance of individual species based on changes in stability and food web fragmentation. We explore connections between interaction strength and key topological properties of the food web. Our findings reveal an asymmetric distribution of interaction strengths, with a prevalence of weak interactions and a few strong ones. Species exerting greater influence within the food web displayed higher degree and trophic similarity but occupied lower trophic levels and displayed lower omnivory levels (e.g., macroalgae and detritus). Extinction simulations revealed the key role of certain species, particularly amphipods and the black rockcod Notothenia coriiceps, as their removal led to significant changes in food web stability and network fragmentation. This study highlights the importance of considering species interaction strengths in assessing the stability of polar marine ecosystems. These insights have crucial implications for guiding monitoring and conservation strategies aimed at preserving the integrity of Antarctic marine ecosystems.","tags":["Antarctic ecosystem","climate change","marine food web","species interaction strength"],"title":"Potter Cove's Heavyweights: Estimation of Species' Interaction Strength of an Antarctic Food Web","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Leonardo A.

The policies of many conservation agencies are still prioritizing the preservation of a single large habitat area (SL) versus several small areas of the same size (SS), despite empirical support favouring SS. However, to date, while many studies have explored this issue using model communities, the results are mixed. In competitive community models, fragmentation has a negative effect at low habitat amounts, whereas neutral community models suggest positive effects. This work aims to explore spatial multispecies models to verify the SS $\u003e$ SL pattern and determine its causes. We used three types of models: a classical neutral, neutral with habitat selection and a competitive hierarchical model. All models have three parameters, namely extinction, reproduction and dispersal distance. In the classical neutral model, species are equivalent and have the same parameters; when there is a reproduction event, they send the propagule to a surrounding patch blindly, and if the patch is already occupied, the propagule dies. In the neutral with habitat selection model, the propagules select an empty patch, so their survival is ensured. In the hierarchical model, species have competitive dominance and more dominant ones can replace the less dominant with a replacement rate parameter. We use 100 species and start simulating the colonization of an empty area; then, we destroy a fixed amount of habitat using different regular patch sizes. The results for all models are almost always that SS retains more species than SL. The extinction of species in patches depends on the quotient between reproduction and extinction rates in relation to patch size. The only case when SL $\u003e$ SS is when dispersal is insufficient to connect patches, and patch size is smaller than the minimum to prevent extinction. If patch size is above the critical size to maintain local populations, the SS $\u003e$ SL pattern is due to the sampling effect of aggregated species distribution combined with the reduction of dispersal ability of species. High-dispersal rates produce the homogenization of species distribution and a reduction of species richness and this is why habitat fragmentation by habitat loss retains more species when patches are smaller. The model predicts that if a set of species have more dispersal capabilities, the SS effect would be lower than for species with less dispersal.

These organisms have pivotal roles in soil ecosystem functions, such as the breakdown and decomposition of organic matter, the dispersal of bacterial and fungal spores and biological habitat transformation. These functions, in turn, contribute to broader ecosystem services like carbon and nutrient cycling, soil organic matter regulation and both chemical and physical soil fertility.This study provides morphological data pertaining to a range of soil organism sizes, specifically in Argiudol soils subjected to varying levels of agricultural activity in the Rolling Pampas Region, one of the world's most extensive and fertile plains.The primary focus is on soil microarthropods---namely, Acari (mites) and Collembola (springtails)---with a body width of less than 2 mm. These organisms constitute the majority of life in the intricate soil pore network. Additionally, the study documents species of earthworms (Oligochaeta, Crassiclitelata), recognised as ecosystem engineers for their ability to create physical channels in the soil matrix and to distribute organic matter. Moreover, the study includes measurements of morphological traits of soil-dwelling \\\"macrofauna\\\" (organisms with a body width greater than 2 mm), which are also implicated in various soil ecosystem functions. These include population regulation by apex predators, organic matter decomposition, biogenic structure formation, nutrient mobilisation and herbivory.In this paper, we report both the geographical locations and individual measurements of key morphological traits for over 7,000 specimens, covering a range of soil-dwelling organisms.

Identifying and managing these so-called tipping points continues to be a challenge in marine, freshwater, and terrestrial ecosystems, particularly when multiple potentially interacting drivers are present. Knowledge of tipping points, the mechanisms that cause them, and their implications for management practices are evolving, but often in isolation within specific ecological realms. Here we summarize current knowledge of tipping points in marine, freshwater, and terrestrial realms, and provide a multi-realm perspective of the challenges and opportunities for applying this knowledge to ecosystem management. We brought together conservation practitioners and global experts in marine, freshwater, and terrestrial tipping points and identified seven challenges that environmental policymakers and managers contend with including: 1) predictability, 2) spatiotemporal scales, 3) interactions, 4) reversibility, 5) socio-ecological context, 6) complexity and heterogeneity, and 7) selecting appropriate action. We highlight opportunities for cross-scalar and cross-realm knowledge production and provide recommendations for enabling management of tipping points. Although knowledge of tipping points is imperfect, we stress the need to continue working towards incorporating tipping points perspectives in environmental management across all realms.","tags":null,"title":"A Multi-Realm Perspective on Applying Potential Tipping Points to Environmental Decision-Making","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Andrés Esteban Duhour","Hernán de la Vega","Liliana Falco","Carlos Coviella","Nicolás Velazco","Rosana V.

Although, the available information about trophic relationships is hard to find and fragmented. Most of the informations available worldwide about the food resources of soil microarthropods suggested that out of 3105 hits of initial research on this aspect only a total of 196 published works related particular species, genera, and families to particular trophic resources, the majority of them dealing with soils of the Palearctic region. From the 196 publications we extracted 3009 records relating specific taxonomic groups to their trophic resources, 20 percent mention saprophytic fungi as a food resource, 16 percent cite microfauna, 11 percent mention bacteria, 10 percent litter and 8 percent cite Springtails. The available information was highly skewed, the 73.71 percent comes from Acari, and within these, 50.62 percent correspond just to Sarcoptiformes. The literature on Collembola is very scarce and most of the information is on arthropleona. The review also highlights that available research on the use of trophic resources comes from European sites and the information on this aspect from other parts of the soils of the world is still at large but unknown.","tags":["Acari","Collembola","food web","soil microarthropods","trophic ecology"],"title":"Trophic Resources of the Edaphic Microarthropods: A Worldwide Review of the Empirical Evidence","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Irene R.

It is characterized by intricate coastlines and changing bathymetry, a dominant West to East circulation pattern, and a strong longitudinal gradient of glacial fresh-water discharge. Harmful algal blooms (HAB) and toxic outbreaks have been detected along the channel for the last two decades and monitored by both Chilean and Argentinean agencies. This unique scenario was used to try to answer whether HABs propagate from West to East along the channel following the main water flow, so that a sequential, spatial pattern can be identified, or if local dynamics due to particular hydrographic characteristics might favor HAB formation in different areas along the channel. For this analysis, we selected data from three austral spring-summer seasons, 2009--2010, 2010--2011, and 2012--2013, when by means of the mouse bioassay important concentrations of saxitoxins (STX) derivatives were detected in shellfish from different stations along the channel. Relevant information on hydrographical (temperature, salinity, bathymetry, main currents), chemical (macronutrients), and biological (cell abundance of the main species responsible for the toxic outbreaks in the channel, i.e. Alexandrium catenella) characteristics are analyzed. Results show that during the years when toxicity was highest, there was no evidence of West to East (longitudinal) transport of toxins along the channel. Contrastingly, smaller-scale patterns could explain the observed dynamics associated with three sub-basins previously described for the Beagle Channel, identified as western, central, and eastern regions. We built a conceptual model based on own and published data on bathymetry, PAR, salinity, water residence time, silicate availability, and DOM to understand the differences in HAB presence among the sub-basins, which allows explaining the higher toxicity values registered in the central part of the channel as compared to the western or easternmost regions.","tags":["Beagle Channel","Harmful algal blooms","Hydrography","PSP","Subbasins","Toxicity"],"title":"Alexandrium Catenella Dynamics and Paralytic Shellfish Toxins Distribution along the Beagle Channel (Southern Patagonia)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Giorgio Nicoletti","Leonardo A.

Yet the combined effects of landscape composition and pollinator traits (especially specialisation) on pollination success remain hard to quantify empirically. We used an individual-based model to explore how landscape and pollinator specialisation (degree) interact to influence pollination. We modelled variation in the landscape by generating gradients of plant species intermixing---from no mixing to complete intermixing. Furthermore, we varied the level of pollinator specialisation by simulating plant--pollinator (six to eight species) networks of different connectance. We then compared the impacts of these drivers on three proxies for pollination: visitation rate, number of consecutive visits to the focal plant species and expected number of plants pollinated. We found that the spatial arrangements of plants and pollinator degree interact to determine pollination success, and that the influence of these drivers on pollination depends on how pollination is estimated. For most pollinators, visitation rate increases in more plant mixed landscapes. Compared to the two more functional measures of pollination, visitation rate overestimates pollination service. This is particularly severe in landscapes with high plant intermixing and for generalist pollinators. Interestingly, visitation rate is less influenced by pollinator traits (pollinator degree and body size) than are the two functional metrics, likely because `visitation rate' ignores the order in which pollinators visit plants. However, the visitation sequence order is crucial for the expected number of plants pollinated, since only prior visits to conspecific individuals can contribute to pollination. We show here that this order strongly depends on the spatial arrangements of plants, on pollinator traits and on the interaction between them. Taken together, our findings suggest that visitation rate, the most commonly used proxy for pollination in network studies, should be complemented with more functional metrics which reflect the frequency with which individual pollinators revisit the same plant species. Our findings also suggest that measures of landscape structure such as plant intermixing and density---in combination with pollinators' level of specialism---can improve estimates of the probability of pollination.

In the long term, some species are more vulnerable to fishery impacts than others, which can lead to permanent changes on the food web. The trophic relationships between predator and prey constitute the food web and it represents a network of the energy channels in an ecosystem. In turn, the network structure influences ecosystem diversity and stability. The first aim of this study was to describe for the first time the food web of the San Jorge Gulf (Patagonia Argentina) with high resolution, i.e.~to the species level when information is available. The San Jorge Gulf was subject to intense fisheries thus our second aim is to analyse the food web structure with and without fishery to evaluate if the bottom-trawl industrial fishery altered the network structure and stability. We used several network metrics like: mean trophic level, omnivory, modularity and quasi-sign stability. We included these metrics because they are related to stability and can be evaluated using predator diets that can weight the links between predators and prey. The network presented 165 species organized in almost five trophic levels. The inclusion of a fishery node adds 69 new trophic links. All weighted and unweighted metrics showed differences between the two networks, reflecting a decrease in stability when fishery was included in the system. Thus, our results suggested a probable change of state of the system. The observed changes in species abundances since the fishery was established, could represent the state change predicted by network analysis. Our results suggests that changes in the stability of food webs can be used to evaluate the impacts of human activity on ecosystems.","tags":["Ecological networks","Ecology"],"title":"Network Analysis Suggests Changes in Food Web Stability Produced by Bottom Trawl Fishery in Patagonia","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tomas I. Marina","Leonardo A. Saravia"],"categories":[],"content":"In nature species interact among each other in many ways. The most common and studied interaction is that between a predator and its prey. A food web can be defined as a network of interactions that describes who eats whom in a certain ecosystem and at a certain time of the year. In any ecosystem, in a terrestrial, freshwater or marine environment, the so-called food web is comprised by lots of species (hundreds) and interactions (thousands), showing a complex network of predator-prey interactions.\nIn a recent paper in the Journal of Animal Ecology, we studied the assembly process of food webs, that means how the complex network of interactions is formed and which are the principal factors that drive such processes. To put it in simple words, our research question was the following: what determines the structure of a food web?\nDue to previous investigations of colleagues we now know that the structure of a food web is the result of community assembly, which is a repeated process of species arrival, colonisation and local extinction. This implies that there are two major components that determine the structure of a food web: 1) the composition of species from where individuals migrate to new habitats, referred to as the regional pool or metaweb; and 2) a selective process that determines which species can arrive and persist in the new habitat. We also know that the first to colonise new habitats are species with a broad diet (i.e. great variety of prey). Thus, predator-prey interactions are established during the assembly process that begins the formation of a network of interactions: the food web “in progress”. Added to this, the characteristics of the habitat (substrate, climatic conditions) and the dispersal capability of the species are important factors that also control the assembly process of the food web, determining which species might be able to persist in time.\nThe structure of a food web is ultimately constrained by the species and potential interactions that exist in the regional pool, that is, the metaweb. Such metaweb is shaped by evolutionary and biogeographical processes that imply large spatial and temporal scales, containing many habitats and communities. Each of the local communities can have different food web structures, in terms of species and interactions among them. Some theorists conceive of assembly as a non-Darwinian selection process, whereby species and particular structures that destabilise the food web will be lost and stabilising structures will persist. Therefore, we should expect those stabilising structures to be over-represented in local food webs compared to the metaweb.\nTo test the hypothesis that the selective processes are responsible for food web structure, we created an assembly model, where species migrate from a regional pool and persist in a theoretical local food web given at least one prey item available. The model considers colonisation-extinction and secondary extinctions (i.e. if a species arrives and none of its prey are present) events constrained by network structure that is represented by predator-prey interactions. Thus, the model does not include local selective processes and habitat constraints that are thought to control the assembly process. Then we compared the theoretical local food webs created from the assembly model with real food webs. We hypothesised that, if local processes like stability determine the food web structure, then we should observe a consistent difference in the network structural characteristics between real food webs and those assembled from the model. To test our hypothesis we compiled 58 real food webs from a variety of regions and ecosystems: 2 marine food webs from Antarctica, 50 freshwater ones from the Adirondacks region and 6 from an Arthropod community in six islands of the Florida Keys.\nContrary to our expectations, we found that most structural characteristics didn’t differ between the real and modeled food webs. We particularly compared properties related to stability, such as modularity and the frequency of three-species motifs, and habitat filtering and dispersal limitation, such as topological roles that characterise how many interactions a species has within their module and/or between modules (i.e. modules are formed by a group of species that share more interactions compared to other species). This suggests that evolutionary and biogeographical processes that are established in the metaweb are more important and might drive the studied structural characteristics in a food web than local processes such as habitat filtering and dispersal limitations. In particular, our study forces us to re-think the way we approach the study of food web structure. The network properties that we as ecologists commonly use to shed light on this aspect might be a by-product of the assembly process already driven at the metaweb spatial and temporal scales.\nMore info: Check the complete publication here\n","date":1644451200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1644516729,"objectID":"1b8d18dcfadd256eef2b2496b8c94e8e","permalink":"https://lsaravia.github.io/post/what-determines-food-web-structure2022/","publishdate":"2022-02-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/what-determines-food-web-structure2022/","section":"post","summary":"In nature species interact among each other in many ways.

Within the framework of the Shellfish Toxicity Monitoring Program carried out close to Almanza in Beagle Channel eastern coastal waters, here we analyzed the spatiotemporal patterns of PSP toxins in the Magellan mussel Aulacomya ater and the blue mussel Mytilus edulis, measured by the mouse bioassay for 12 years, between 2005 -- 2017. PSP outbreaks occurred mostly during summer and their duration was significantly longer than for outbreaks detected during spring and winter. A marked interannual variability in their magnitude was also evident. The largest outbreaks were detected in summers 2010 - 2011, in extreme warm and low-wind conditions, reaching up to 5600 textmug saxitoxin equivalent per 100 g of tissue, causing a closure of shellfish fisheries of up to 200 days. Small scale spatial variability in PSP was also found, the highest values being observed in the main mussel culture areas, and the lowest in the natural mussel beds. PSP toxicities for the Magellan mussel were significantly higher than for the blue mussel. Natural detoxification in mussels from Beagle Channel followed an exponential decay, with mean detoxification rates of 3.5% toxin day-1, lower than those from elsewhere in the world for similar PSP toxin concentrations, which means a longer time to attain concentration limits safe for human consumption. Understanding PSP dynamics is important to avoid large economic losses related to halting mussel production.","tags":["harmful algae","mussel culture","natural detoxification","toxicity"],"title":"Spatiotemporal Distribution of Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning (PSP) Toxins in Beagle Channel (South America) during 2005 -- 2017","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Leonardo A.

Local food webs result from a sequence of colonisations and extinctions by species from the regional pool or metaweb, i.e., the assembly process. Assembly is theorised to be a selective process: whether or not certain species or network structures can persist is partly determined by local processes including habitat filtering and dynamical constraints. Consequently, local food web structure should reflect these processes. 2. The goal of this study was to test evidence for these selective processes by comparing the structural properties of real food webs to the expected distribution given the metaweb. We were particularly interested in ecological dynamics; if the network properties commonly associated with dynamical stability are indeed the result of stability constraints, then they should deviate from expectation in the direction predicted by theory. 3. To create a null expectation, we used the novel approach of randomly assembling model webs by drawing species and interactions from the empirical metaweb. The assembly model permitted colonisation and extinction, and required a consumer species to have at least one prey, but had no habitat type nor population dynamical constraints. Three data sets were used: (1) the marine Antarctic metaweb, with 2 local food-webs; (2) the 50 lakes of the Adirondacks; and (3) the arthropod community from Florida Keys’ classic defaunation experiment. 4. Contrary to our expectations, we found that there were almost no differences between empirical webs and those resulting from the null assembly model. Few empirical food webs showed significant differences with network properties, motif representations and topological roles. Network properties associated with stability did not deviate from expectation in the direction predicted by theory. 5. Our results suggest that — for the commonly used metrics we considered — local food web structure is not strongly influenced by dynamical nor habitat restrictions. Instead, the structure is inherited from the metaweb. This suggests that the network properties typically attributed as causes or consequences of ecological stability are instead a by-product of the assembly process (i.e., spandrels), and may potentially be too coarse to detect the true signal of dynamical constraint.","tags":["metawebs","ecological network assembly","ecological Networks","food web structure","modularity","QSS Stability","motifs","topological roles"],"title":"Ecological network assembly: how the regional metaweb influences local food webs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Stacey A.

These food webs vary in response to a combination of physical and chemical processes that alter productivity, species composition and the relative abundance and dynamics of organisms. Combined with regional and seasonal variability, climate-induced changes and human activities have and are expected to continue to drive important structural and functional changes to Southern Ocean food webs. However, our current understanding of food web structure, function, status, and trends is patchy in space and time, and methods for systematically assessing and comparing community-level responses to change within and across regional and temporal scales are not well developed. Insights gained from food web modelling studies---ranging from theoretical analyses of ecosystem resilience and adaptation, to qualitative and quantitative descriptions of the system---can assist in resolving patterns of energy flow and the ecological mechanisms that drive food web structure, function, and responses to drivers (such as fishing and climate change). This understanding is required to inform robust management strategies to conserve Southern Ocean food webs and the ecosystem services they underpin in the face of change. This paper synthesises the current state of knowledge regarding Southern Ocean pelagic food webs, highlighting the distinct regional food web characteristics, including key drivers of energy flow, dominant species, and network properties that may indicate system resilience. In particular, the insights, gaps, and potential integration of existing knowledge and Southern Ocean food web models are evaluated as a basis for developing integrated food web assessments that can be used to test the efficacy of alternative management and policy options. We discuss key limitations of existing models for assessing change resulting from various drivers, summarise priorities for model development and identify that significant progress could be made to support policy by advancing the development of food web models coupled to projected biogeochemical models, such as in Earth System models.","tags":null,"title":"Southern Ocean Food Web Modelling: Progress, Prognoses, and Future Priorities for Research and Policy Makers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Georgina Cordone","Vanesa Salinas","Tomás I.

Potter Cove (25 de Mayo/King George Island) is one of the most biodiverse and studied fjords on the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP), where climate change is affecting benthic and pelagic communities. This fjord ecosystem presents a considerable degree of environmental and species distribution heterogeneity across space: the outer portion of the cove is dominated by hard bottoms meanwhile the inner portion is dominated by soft bottoms. In this work, we have incorporated habitat type to a highly-resolved Antarctic food web, and evaluated its effects on different network metrics and proxies for various dimensions of stability. We considered a multidimensional perspective and employed simulation techniques to encompass variability. Our results showed that the incorporation of habitat type to Potter Cove food web analysis led to two different functional types of networks segregated on space: a green food web (in the outer cove) and a brown food web (in the inner cove). The green and the brown food webs showed significant differences in network structure and in some proxies for multidimensional stability (i.e. quasi sign-stability and omnivory), suggesting that these two food webs have different resilience to perturbations. However, there were no changes in network robustness when in silico experiments were performed. We conclude that habitat type plays a significant role in the structure and stability of Antarctic food webs, and should be taken into account to design effective conservation strategies.","tags":["Climate change","Hard bottom","Quasi sign-stability","Soft bottom","Strona curve-ball algorithm","West Antarctic Peninsula"],"title":"Green vs Brown Food Web: Effects of Habitat Type on Multidimensional Stability Proxies for a Highly-Resolved Antarctic Food Web","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Leonardo A.

To install it, clone the repository using git clone or download and compile it, following the instructions in the README.\nThe model description from 1 is the following:\nThe second model again involves a set of S (possible) species plus empty sites (pseudospecies labelled 0). This set (the species pool) $\\Omega(S)$ is then a discrete set:\n$\\Omega(S) = {0,1,2,…,S}$\nwhere 0 indicates empty space, available to all species from the pool. Three basic types of transition are allowed to occur. Let us call $ A,B \\in \\Omega(S )$ two given spcies present at a given step. These possible transitions are summarized as follows.\n(i) Immigration: an empty site is occupied by a species randomly chosen from the set of (non-empty) species, i.e. $A \\in \\Omega(S )-{0}$:\n$0 \\xrightarrow{u_i} A$\nThis occurs with a probability of colonization (of empty sites) $\\mu_i$ . Notice that this colonization depends on the particular species.\n(ii) Death: All occupied sites can become empty with some fixed probability $e_i$ :\n$A \\xrightarrow{e_i} 0$\n(iii) Interaction: the same rule as in model A is used, but here the probability of success $P_{ij}$ is weighted by the coefficients of the interaction matrix. Here we use\n$P_{ij} = \\pi[\\Omega_{ij} - \\Omega_{ji}]$\nwhere $\\pi[x]=x$ when $x \u0026gt; 0$ and zero otherwise.

Due to climate warming, Antarctic marine ecosystems are being affected by glacier retreat opening new habitats, e.g., newly ice-free areas that can be colonized by macroalgae. As a consequence, primary production and fate of macroalgae are changing in these new polar environments. In these ecosystems, the carbon production, especially from large brown algae, is an important food source to the benthic invertebrate communities mainly when other resources are scarce. Thus, in new areas colonized by seaweeds, the trophic structure and biogeochemical fluxes can vary considerably. Moreover, when seaweeds die or are removed by water movement, ice scouring, or storms, they are detached, fragmented, and degraded, incorporating and releasing particulate and dissolved organic matter to the coastal food webs, i.e., they support a large fraction of the secondary production of the benthos. The present chapter is a review of the knowledge on seaweed biomass and production in the coastal Antarctic ecosystem opening a discussion on the role of these organisms as main energy sources in, e.g., small fjords and glacier-influenced sites, impacted by recent climatic change.","tags":["Carbon flux","Glacier retreat","Ice-free areas","Potter Cove","Seaweed production"],"title":"Production and Biomass of Seaweeds in Newly Ice-Free Areas: Implications for Coastal Processes in a Changing Antarctic Environment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fernando R.

Whether through direct consumption or via detritus, their role in maintaining biodiversity is essential. However, their relevance is due not only by direct trophic interactions but also by indirect feedbacks, since macroalgae act as a habitat and refuge for multiple benthic organisms and as a substrate for epiphytic microalgae. Macroalgae also establish relations of exploitative competition, apparent competition, and mutualism. The control over the biomass and diversity of the macroalgae itself does not seem to be due to trophic interactions (top-down control) but rather to competition and diverse abiotic factors such as substrata and light availability or physical disturbances (ice scouring). The extreme connectivity of trophic networks linked to algae and their detritus determines that food webs are robust to local extinctions; however, non-trophic interactions indicate that changes that affect the growth, biomass, and distribution of macroalgae can have dramatic effects on the diversity of their associated fauna and, indirectly, on the networks of consumers of that fauna.

En la Antártida, el microfitobentos se encuentra principalmente dominado por diatomeas (Zacher et al. 2007, Campana et al. 2009, Wulff et al. 2011) y tiene un rol importante en el proceso sucesional ya que son las primeras en colonizar el fondo rocoso (Zacher et al. 2007, Campana et al. 2017). Las macroalgas son fuente de alimentación para organismos asociados al bentos (Amsler et al. 2005) y representan un aporte significativo de materia orgánica particulada y disuelta a la trama trófica costera (Fischer y Wiencke, 1992). Además provén hábitat y refugio para numerosos organismos bentónicos y bento-pelágicos (Wiencke y Amsler 2014). En las últimas décadas se observó un marcado retroceso del glaciar que rodea caleta Potter, dejando al descubierto áreas rocosas sin hielo, potencialmente aptas para ser colonizadas por macroalgas. A partir del 2008 se iniciaron una serie de estudios a fin de describir y cuantificar el efecto de las perturbaciones asociadas al retroceso glaciario tales como el aumento en la carga de sedimento y la consiguiente disminución del grado de penetración de la luz sobre la comunidad de algas bentónicas de la caleta. Las primeras observaciones mostraron una notable presencia de algas en aquellos sitios donde antes no se encontraban presentes e inclusive fueron registradas creciendo en sitios altamente disturbados próximos al glaciar (Quartino et al. 2013).\nEn el ecosistema de caleta Potter las zonas costeras de fondos rocosos están mayormente colonizadas por las grandes algas pardas endémicas Desmarestia menziesii J.Agardh, D. anceps Montagne e Himantothallus grandifolius(A.Gepp \u0026amp; E.S.Gepp) Zinova. Estas macroalgas presentan los mayores valores de biomasa (Quartino y Boraso de Zaixso 2008), son endémicas de la Antártida e islas adyacentes y están adaptadas a las temperaturas frías extremas, por lo que podrían verse afectadas ante el inminente calentamiento global (Wiencke y Amsler 2012). Un calentamiento creciente, junto con variaciones en la disponibilidad de luz en zonas costeras, debido a la mayor carga de sedimento proveniente del agua de deshielo de los glaciares, podría llevar a consecuencias imprevistas para los productores primarios bentónicos (macroalgas) y su fauna asociada. Esto, a su vez, podría afectar el funcionamiento del ecosistema costero antártico, tal como ya lo han observado en el Ártico (Bartsch et al. 2016), en donde se han registrado variaciones en la biomasa de las comunidades 1macroalgales, en la fauna asociada y en los invertebrados bentónicos (por ej., aumento de organismos filtradores).

It is known that a critical transition exists between these two states, but the spatial aspect of this transition has not been studied. Our aim is to study the spatial aspect of the transition and propose early warning signals to detect it. We used a stochastic, spatially explicit model that spans a continuum from neutral to niche communities, and is driven by the intensity of hierarchical competition. The transition is indicated by the emergence of a large patch formed by one species that connects the whole area. The properties of this patch can be used as early warning indicators of a critical transition. If competition intensity increases beyond the critical point, our model shows a sudden decrease of the Shannon diversity index and a gentle decline in species richness. The critical point occurs at a very low value of competitive intensity, with the rate of migration from the metacommunity greatly influencing the position of this critical point. As an example, we apply our new method of early warning indicators to the Barro Colorado Tropical forest, which, as expected, appears to be far from a critical transition. Low values of competitive intensity were also reported by previous studies for different high-diversity real communities, suggesting that these communities are located before the critical point. A small increase of competitive interactions could push them across the transition, however, to a state in which diversity is much lower. Thus this new early warnings indicator could be used to monitor high diversity ecosystems that are still undisturbed.","tags":null,"title":"Biodiversity Collapse and Early Warning Indicators in a Spatial Phase Transition between Neutral and Niche Communities","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tomás I.

A food-web approach includes both species and energy flows among them, providing a natural framework for characterizing species’ ecological roles and the mechanisms through which biodiversity influences ecosystem dynamics. Here we present for the first time a high-resolution food web for a marine ecosystem at Potter Cove (northern Antarctic Peninsula). Eleven food web properties were analyzed in order to document network complexity, structure and topology. We found a low linkage density (3.4), connectance (0.04) and omnivory percentage (45), as well as a short path length (1.8) and a low clustering coefficient (0.08). Furthermore, relating the structure of the food web to its dynamics, an exponential degree distribution (in- and out-links) was found. This suggests that the Potter Cove food web may be vulnerable if the most connected species became locally extinct. For two of the three more connected functional groups, competition overlap graphs imply high trophic interaction between demersal fish and niche specialization according to feeding strategies in amphipods. On the other hand, the prey overlap graph shows also that multiple energy pathways of carbon flux exist across benthic and pelagic habitats in the Potter Cove ecosystem. Although alternative food sources might add robustness to the web, network properties (low linkage density, connectance and omnivory) suggest fragility and potential trophic cascade effects.","tags":["Antarctica","Degree distribution","Ecological Networks","Marine ecosystem"],"title":"The Food Web of Potter Cove (Antarctica): Complexity, Structure and Function","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tomás I.

One such property is the small-world topology that combines a high clustering and a small distance between nodes of the network. This property may increase food web resilience but make them more sensitive to the extinction of connected species. Food web theory has been developed principally from freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems, largely omitting marine habitats. If theory needs to be modified to accommodate observations from marine ecosystems, based on major differences in several topological characteristics is still on debate. Here we investigated if the small-world topology is a common structural pattern in marine food webs. We developed a novel, simple and statistically rigorous method to examine the largest set of complex marine food webs to date. More than half of the analyzed marine networks exhibited a similar or lower characteristic path length than the random expectation, whereas 39% of the webs presented a significantly higher clustering than its random counterpart. Our method proved that 5 out of 28 networks fulfilled both features of the small-world topology: short path length and high clustering. This work represents the first rigorous analysis of the small-world topology and its associated features in high-quality marine networks. We conclude that such topology is a structural pattern that is not maximized in marine food webs; thus it is probably not an effective model to study robustness, stability and feasibility of marine ecosystems.","tags":null,"title":"Architecture of Marine Food Webs: To Be or Not Be a `Small-World'","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Georgina Cordone","Tomás I Marina","Vanesa Salinas","Santiago R Doyle","Leonardo A.

Potter Cove is a WAP fjord at Shetland Islands that constitutes a biodiversity hotspot where over the last years, Potter Cove annual air temperatures averages increased by 0.66 $^∘$C, coastal glaciers declined, and suspended particulate matter increased due to ice melting. Macroalgae are the main energy source for all consumers and detritivores of Potter Cove. Some effects of climate change favor pioneer macroalgae species that exploit new ice-free areas and can also decline rates of photosynthesis and intensify competition between species due to the increase of suspended particulate matter. In this study, we evaluated possible consequences of climate change at Potter Cove food web by simulating the extinction of macroalgae and detritus using a topological approach with thresholds of extinction. Thresholds represent the minimum number of incoming links necessary for species' survival. When we simulated the extinctions of macroalgae species at random, a threshold of extinction beyond 50% was necessary to obtain a significant number of secondary extinctions, while with a 75% threshold a real collapse of the food web occurred. Our results indicate that Potter Cove food web is relative robust to macroalgae extinction. This is dramatically different from what has been found in other food webs, where the reduction of 10% in prey intake caused a disproportionate increase of secondary extinctions. Robustness of the Potter Cove food web was mediated by omnivory and redundancy, which had an important relevance in this food web. When we eliminated larger-biomass species more secondary extinctions occurred, a similar response was observed when more connected species were deleted, yet there was no correlation between species of larger-biomass and high-degree. This similarity could be explained because both criteria involved key species that produced an emerging effect on the food web. In this way, large-biomass and high-degree species could be acting as source for species with few trophic interactions or low redundancy. Based on this work, we expect the Potter Cove food web to be robust to changes in macroalgae species caused by climate change until a high threshold of stress is reached, and then negative effects are expected to spread through the entire food web leading to its collapse.","tags":["Antarctic","Extinctions","Food webs","Macroalgae loss"],"title":"Effects of Macroalgae Loss in an Antarctic Marine Food Web: Applying Extinction Thresholds to Food Web Studies","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Leonardo A.

However, in Antarctica, further studies are needed for a more complete understanding of these systems. When conspicuous Antarctic intertidal communities occur, macroalgae are a key component. Given that intertidal communities have a fast response to variations in environmental conditions and could reflect climate fluctuations, we conducted a non-destructive study with photographic transects in an intertidal zone at Potter Peninsula, Isla 25 de Mayo/King George Island, over four years and during five months of the warm season. We tested the general hypothesis that macroalgal intertidal communities are mainly structured by the vertical stress gradient and that changes in temperature between seasons and between years have a great influence in the macroalgal community structure. Spatial, seasonal and inter-annual variations were studied using GLM, quantile regression and NMDS ordinations. The vertical stress gradient was the main factor that explained macroalgal cover. The Low and the Middle level shared similarities, but the latter was more variable. The High level had the lowest cover, richness and diversity. The dominant species here was the endemic red alga Pyropia endiviifolia, which is strongly adapted to extreme conditions. At the Middle level, there was a significant increase in macroalgal cover during spring months, and it stabilized in summer. Inter-annual variations showed that there is a strong variation in the total macroalgal cover and community structure over the studied years. Environmental conditions have a significant effect in shaping the studied intertidal community, which is very sensitive to climate oscillations. An increase in temperature produced a decrease of annual ice foot cover, number of snow days and - as a result - an increase in macroalgal cover. In a global climate-change scenario, a shift in species composition could also occur. Species with wide physiological tolerance that grow in warmer conditions, like Palmaria decipiens, could benefit, while other species will be discriminated. More detailed studies are necessary to predict future changes in Antarctic intertidal communities.","tags":["Aquatic communities","Benthos","Community structure","Ecological zonation","Isla 25 de Mayo/King George Island","Seaweeds"],"title":"Life between Tides: Spatial and Temporal Variations of an Intertidal Macroalgal Community at Potter Peninsula, South Shetland Islands, Antarctica","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Leonardo A.

Three soil uses were evaluated: 1-Fifty year old naturalized grasslands, low use intensity; 2-Recent agricultural fields, intermediate use intensity, and 3-Fifty year old intensive agricultural fields, high use intensity. Three different sites for each soil use were evaluated from winter 2008 through summer 2011. Nine earthworm species were identified across all sampling sites. The sites shared five species: the native Microscolex dubius, and the introduced Aporrectodea caliginosa, A. rosea, Octalasion cyaneum, and O. lacteum, but they differed in relative abundance by soil use. The results show that the earthworm community structure is linked to and modulated by soil properties. Both species abundance and diversity showed significant differences depending on soil use intensity. A principal component analysis showed that species composition is closely related to the environmental variability. The ratio of native to exotic species was significantly lower in the intensive agricultural system when compared to the other two, lower disturbance systems. Microscolex dubius abundance was related to naturalized grasslands along with soil Ca, pH, mechanical resistance, and microbial respiration. Aporrectodea caliginosa abundance was related to high K levels, low enzymatic activity, slightly low pH, low Ca, and appeared related to the highly disturbed environment. Eukerria stagnalis and Aporrectodea rosea, commonly found in the recent agricultural system, were related to high soil moisture condition, low pH, low Ca and low enzymatic activity. These results show that earthworm assemblages can be good indicators of soil use intensities. In particular, Microscolex dubius, Aporrectodea caliginosa, and Aporrectodea rosea, showed different temporal patterns and species associations, due to the changes in soil properties attributable to soil use intensity, defined as the amount and type of agricultural operations.","tags":["Bioindicator","Earthworms","Farming systems","Soil ecology","Soil use intensity"],"title":"Earthworm Assemblages in Different Intensity of Agricultural Uses and Their Relation to Edaphic Variables","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Leonardo A.

Phytoplankton biomass is typically low compared to other Antarctic shelf environments, with average spring - summer values below 1 mg chlorophyll a m-3. The physical conditions in the area (reduced irradiance induced by particles originated from the land, intense winds) limit the coastal productivity at King George Island (KGI), as a result of shallow Sverdrup's critical depths (Zc) and large turbulent mixing depths (Zt). In January 2010 a large phytoplankton bloom with a maximum of around 20, and monthly averages of 4 (PC) and 6 (AB) mg chlorophyll a m-3, was observed in the area, making it by far the largest recorded bloom over the last 20 years. Dominant phytoplankton species were the typical bloom-forming diatoms that are usually found in the western Antarctic Peninsula area. Anomalously cold air temperature and dominant winds from the eastern sector seem to explain adequate light:mixing environment. Local physical conditions were analyzed by means of the relation between Zc and Zt and conditions were found adequate for allowing phytoplankton development. However, a multi-year analysis indicates that these conditions may be necessary but not sufficient to guarantee phytoplankton accumulation. The relation between maximum chlorophyll a values and air temperature suggests that bottom-up control would render such large blooms even less frequent in KGI under the warmer climate expected in the area during the second half of the present century.","tags":null,"title":"On the Phytoplankton Bloom in Coastal Waters of Southern King George Island (Antarctica) in January 2010: An Exceptional Feature?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Leonardo A.

We analyzed the spatial pattern of a periphyton community along a succession developed in experimental tanks. Our aim was to identify regularities that may help us to explain the patchiness of this community. Therefore, we estimated the spatial pattern of periphyton biomass using a non-destructive image analysis technique to obtain a temporal series of the spatial distribution. These were analyzed using multifractal techniques. Multifractals are analogous to fractals but they look at the geometry of quantities instead of the geometry of pattern. To use these techniques the object of study must show scale invariance and then can be characterized by a spectra of fractal dimensions. Selforganization describes the evolution of complex structures that emerge spontaneously driven internally by variations of the system itself. The spatial distribution of biomass showed scale invariance at all stages of succession and as the periphyton developed in a homogeneous landscape, in a demonstration of self-organized behavior. Self-organization to a critical state (SOC) is presented in the complex systems literature as a general explanation for scale invariance in nature. SOC requires a mechanism where the history of past events in a place influence the actual dynamics, this was termed ecological memory. The scale invariance was found from the very beginning of the succession thus selforganized criticality is a very improbable explanation for the pattern because there would be not enough time for the build up of ecological memory. Positive interactions between algae and bacteria, and the existence of different spatial scales of colonization and growth are the likely causes of this pattern.

However, the frequency of occurrence of supertransients is currently poorly understood even in model systems. Here we explore their occurrence in metapopulation models which relax the important assumption of global synchrony of events implicit in all the coupled map lattice models for which supertransients have so far been demonstrated. We find supertransients in all the models but always only for a very restricted range of parameter combinations. However, we also report for the first time another type of longer-lived transient (mesotransients) that occurs on shorter time-scales than supertransients and is found for a much wider set of conditions.

A non-destructive method based on photography and digitalization, for the estimation of Chla of periphyton colonizing artificial substrata is presented. The standard spectrophotometric method was used to obtain a calibration curve. The relative errors of the proposed method were similar to those of other published methods. The photographic method should be used when a large quantity of samples from the same community is needed and a high precision on the individual measurement is not required.","tags":["chla","non destructive estimation","non-destructive estimation","periphyton","time series","time-series"],"title":"A Photographic Method for Estimating Chlorophyll in Periphyton on Artificial Substrata","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Leonardo A.

This temporal variability is mainly produced by changes in running water velocity. The shear force caused by the friction of water over the surface of the periphyton produces a removal of biomass and creates open sites for colonization. Running water also brings new suspended algae that can establish on open sites. An increase in the velocity of the water can also improve the renewal of nutrients in depleted areas and the elimination of waste products, producing higher reproductive rates. In this paper, we have developed a model of periphyton biomass dynamics taking the water velocity and nutrient concentration as external driving variables influencing immigration, removal and reproductive rate of the algae. We fitted the model to field data encompassing high and low water velocities and different seasons. We have qualitatively compared the parameters obtained from different situations with the expected ones based on bibliographic information. The model has shown a good fit to field data and parameters were similar to expected ones, giving evidence that the model provides a good description for the processes that dominate the periphyton dynamics in running waters.

The spatio-temporal order of events is a new feature of these models that does not have to be considered in equivalent non-spatial models. We considered simple stochastic cellular automata to test sensitivity of model response under different spatial and temporal sequences of events. The results indicate that very important differences in model output can be found as spatio-temporal ordering is changed, even in a very simple model. A careful choice of the way events are evaluated has to be made: the spatio-temporal ordering must be selected to match the biological characteristics of the target ecological system to be modelled. Further, a complete description of the details of this ordering should be specified in order to let others reproduce published simulation experiments.","tags":["asynchrony","model assumptions","spatial dynamics","stochastic cellular automata","synchrony"],"title":"The Need for Biological Realism in the Updating of Cellular Automata Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"97f061f6e721d99ff473e04294bd8fcf","permalink":"https://lsaravia.github.io/tags/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/tags/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"landing"}]
